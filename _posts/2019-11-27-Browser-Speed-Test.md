A browser speed test is a computer benchmark that scores the performance of a web browser, by measuring the browser's efficiency in completing a predefined list of tasks. In general the testing software is available online, located on a website, where different algorithms are loaded and performed in the browser client. Typical test tasks are rendering and animation, DOM transformations, string operations, mathematical calculations, sorting algorithms, graphic performance tests and memory instructions. Browser speed tests have been used during browser wars to prove superiority of specific web browsers. The popular Acid3 test is no particular speed test but checks browser conformity to web standards (though it checks whether a general performance goal is met).

Peacekeeper is a platform-independent benchmark by Futuremark that tests rendering, mathematical and memory operations. It takes approx. 5 minutes for execution and tells the results of other browsers with different CPUs. Futuremark stopped maintaining Peacekeeper in July 2015. The test was taken offline in March 2018 and is no longer available.

Test of [JavaScript](https://org1979.github.io/Chakra-Javascript-Engine) engine using simple algorithms. Displays results of other visitors (best, average, poorest) with same operating system and browser version. Additional statistics page with browser ranking. Microsoft maintains a suite of performance-oriented tests, often designed to test and stress JavaScript and rendering performance. These tests are typically designed to highlight IE's performance, but are compatible with other major browsers.

Online speed test by Basemark BasemarkÂ® Web 3. 0 is a comprehensive web browser performance benchmark that tests how well your mobile or desktop system can use modern web-based applications. This benchmark includes various system and graphic tests that use the newest web standards and features. After running the benchmark you will see how your system performed compared to other systems and browsers in Basemark Power Board.

Basemark Web 3. 0 is a hardware- and platform-independent, supporting virtually all modern browsers, operating systems, and mobile or desktop systems. WebXPRT is a cross-platform browser benchmark that runs HTML5- and JavaScript-based workloads. The benchmark provides scores for six individual workloads, as well as an overall score. WebXPRT is published by the BenchmarkXPRT Development Community, which is administered by Principled Technologies, and is one of the BenchmarkXPRT benchmarks. WebXPRT 3 is the most current version of WebXPRT.

Performance test for HTML5 3D applications. Tests performance in both Canvas3D and WebGL. Mozilla test suite based on SunSpider tests. Takes several minutes for execution and displays very detailed information about every single test task.

SunSpider is a benchmark created by the webkit team that aims to measure JavaScript performance on tasks relevant to the current and near future use of JavaScript in the real world, such as encryption and text manipulation. The suite further attempts to be balanced and statistically sound. Version 0. 9 was released by the WebKit team in December 2007. It was well received,and other browser developers also use it to compare the JavaScript performance of different browsers.

JavaScript test suite by Google, used to optimize [Google](https://org1981.github.io/Google-Custom-Search) Chrome web browser. Does not test rendering performance. Superseded by Google's Octane benchmark. Google's JavaScript test suite which replaces the V8 benchmark. According to Google, "Octane v.

1 consists of 13 tests, 5 new ones and 8 from the original V8 Benchmark Suite. "Octane v. 2 supplanted v. 1, consisting of "17 tests, four more than Octane v1. "As of April 12 2017, [Google](https://org1981.github.io/Google-Search) no longer maintains Octane.

Tests vector, bitmap, and text rendering for both Adobe Flash and HTML5. .
